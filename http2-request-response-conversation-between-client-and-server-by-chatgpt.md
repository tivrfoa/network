Prompt: What are the steps in the conversation between client and server in a HTTP 2 request/response?

### **HTTP/2 Request/Response Conversation Between Client and Server**  

In HTTP/2, communication happens over a single **multiplexed TCP connection** using **streams**, **frames**, and **flow control**. Below are the steps involved in a typical request/response exchange:

---

### **1. Connection Establishment**
Before any requests are sent, the client and server must establish an HTTP/2 connection.

#### **Step 1: Client Sends Connection Preface**
- The client sends the **HTTP/2 Connection Preface** (`PRI * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n`).
- Immediately follows up with an **initial SETTINGS frame**.

#### **Step 2: Server Responds with SETTINGS**
- The server receives the preface and responds with its own **SETTINGS frame**.
- Both client and server acknowledge each other's settings using an **ACK frame**.

At this point, the HTTP/2 connection is established, and streams can be opened.

---

### **2. Request-Response Exchange**
Once the connection is ready, the actual request/response conversation follows:

#### **Step 3: Client Sends a Request**
The client initiates a new **stream** and sends:
- A **HEADERS frame** (includes HTTP headers like `:method`, `:path`, `:scheme`, and `:authority`).
- Optionally, a **DATA frame** (if the request has a body, such as in a POST request).

ðŸ”¹ **Example: GET Request**
```plaintext
HEADERS (Stream ID: 1)
  :method: GET
  :path: /index.html
  :scheme: https
  :authority: example.com
  accept: text/html
```

---

#### **Step 4: Server Responds**
The server processes the request and responds with:
- A **HEADERS frame** (status code and response headers).
- A **DATA frame** (if there is a response body).

ðŸ”¹ **Example: Response to GET Request**
```plaintext
HEADERS (Stream ID: 1)
  :status: 200
  content-type: text/html
  content-length: 50

DATA (Stream ID: 1)
  <html>...</html>
```

---

### **3. Stream Closure**
Once the response is fully sent:

#### **Step 5: Server Sends END_STREAM Flag**
- If the response is complete, the server sets the **END_STREAM** flag on the last frame (typically the last **DATA frame**).

#### **Step 6: Client Acknowledges**
- The client processes the response.
- If needed, the client can send additional requests over the same connection (multiplexing multiple streams).

---

### **Other Features in HTTP/2**
1. **Multiplexing**: Multiple streams can be active at the same time.
2. **Stream Prioritization**: The client can specify priority for certain streams.
3. **HPACK Header Compression**: Reduces redundant headers across requests.
4. **Flow Control**: Prevents overwhelming the receiver by managing data transfer speed.
5. **Server Push**: The server can proactively send responses that the client hasnâ€™t requested yet.

### **Summary of Steps**
| Step | Client | Server |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Sends connection preface + SETTINGS | Responds with SETTINGS |
| 2 | Sends HTTP request (HEADERS + optional DATA) | Processes request |
| 3 | â€” | Sends response (HEADERS + DATA) |
| 4 | â€” | Marks END_STREAM when response is complete |
| 5 | Processes response | â€” |
